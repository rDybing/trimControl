# trimControl

**trimControl** is an Arduino based controller for flight simulators. Technically working as a standard joystick, but intended to be used as an auxillary controller for whatever one would like to control with it. In IL2 for instance, the trim axis - and toggling with one of the mode switches, control Gyro sights and/or bomb windage adjustments. The buttons can be programmed in game to whatever as well, with it's own toggle switch to change mode of them. Rotary encoder to control radios and such, with button press to latch.

## Build

Intended target is a Sparkfun Pro Micro Arduino clone and developed using PlatformIO. Should work fine with standard Arduino IDE as well. Ensure target MCU is set to Sparkfun Pro Micro and that the libraries this project uses is available for your dev environment.
